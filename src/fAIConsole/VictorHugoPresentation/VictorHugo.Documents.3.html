            "Les Misérables" is a monumental novel by Victor Hugo, set in early 19th-century France.

His journey intertwines with the lives of characters like Fantine, a destitute single mother; Cosette, her innocent daughter; and Javert, a relentless police inspector. The narrative explores themes of social injustice, morality, and love. Amid the backdrop of significant historical events, such as the Battle of Waterloo and the 1832 Paris Uprising, Hugo presents a profound critique of French society's treatment of the poor and marginalized.

The book is a vehement critique of the political regime, using powerful and evocative imagery to depict the corruption and tyranny of the emperor. Hugo's poems oscillate between anger, despair, and hope for a better future. The work is divided into seven books, each representing different stages of the political situation.
